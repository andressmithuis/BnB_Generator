- Generation of Shield Cards

Extra:
- Generation of Health Potion Cards
- You can influence the generation of items by providing the right arguments, but it's not fully implemented yet. It might not work as expected.

Advanced BnB:
- Generation of Gun Cards


How to Use:
In the <main.py> the fuctions are currently enabled/disabled by setting the corresponding section to True/False. Modify these if-statements to what you want to generate.
In case you want to use the Advanced BnB generation rulesets, set the 'USE_ABNB_SYSTEM' to True.
